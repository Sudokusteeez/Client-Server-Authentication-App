# Client-Server-Authentication-App
This project showcases a client-server user authentication application, demonstrating essential cybersecurity skills in socket programming, secure password handling, and database management. The application enables users to input their credentials, and the server validates them against a SQLite database, ensuring secure access to authorized users.

Languages & Programs Used:

Python, Socket Library, SQLite, hashlib

Features:

Secure Client-Server Communication: The client and server communicate over TCP/IP using sockets, ensuring secure data exchange.

Secure Password Handling: User passwords are hashed using hashlib before storage, protecting sensitive data.

User Authentication: The server validates user credentials against a SQLite database, providing secure authentication.

Threading: The server uses threading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, optimizing performance.

Purpose:

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate a practical user authentication system, emphasizing secure socket programming and password hashing. The project showcases proficiency in handling user credentials and establishing secure connections between client and server.

Skills Demonstrated:

Socket Programming: The application showcases proficiency in socket programming, facilitating client-server communication.

SQLite Database Management: The utilization of SQLite demonstrates skills in managing and querying databases.

Secure Password Handling: Hashing passwords using hashlib showcases expertise in secure password management.

Threading: The implementation of threading displays the ability to handle concurrent connections efficiently.

Usage:

Run the server script to initiate the server and establish connections.

Run the client script to connect to the server and enter your username and password for authentication.
